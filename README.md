# Excursion
This project from the Web Development codecademy.com course combined git, github and html5 & css all together for the first time on the course. 
It is also the first time I have put a video on a webpage. I definitely became more familiar with git and its commands - I found it in my code editor and used it committing changes as I made them. Find this web app [here](https://sarahduncan.github.io/excursion/)
