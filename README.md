# Excursion (completed Oct 7th 2021)
This project from the [codecademy.com 'Build a website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages' course](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites) combined Git, GitHub, HTML, and CSS all together for the first time on the course/skillpath. 
This was also the first time I added a video in HTML. I definitely became more familiar with Git and its commands - I found it in my code editor (Visual Studio) and used it to commit changes as I made them. Find this web app [here].(https://sarahduncan.github.io/excursion/)
